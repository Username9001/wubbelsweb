    "Holdie is a pencil holder that is designed to grab your attention when you are distracted by screens for too long. The device is based on the Arduino platform and uses a combination of sensors and actuators to monitor the user's screen time and alert them when they have been sitting in front of a screen for an extended period of time."

    "Holdie is intended to be a helpful tool for people who are prone to getting lost in their screens and losing track of time. The device can be customized to fit the user's needs, allowing them to set their own limits for screen time and choose how they want to be notified when they exceed those limits. Whether it's a gentle reminder to take a break or a more forceful notification to get up and move around, Holdie is designed to help users stay healthy and focused by limiting their screen time."
